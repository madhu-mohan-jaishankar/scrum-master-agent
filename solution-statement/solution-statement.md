Solution Statement


The Problem and Process
Agile teams lose significant productive time every sprint to the overhead of running Scrum itself. Daily standups are slow because nobody has a clear picture of what actually happened since yesterday. Sprint boards drift out of sync with reality. Tickets are marked "In Progress" while the underlying PR has been approved and sitting unmerged for three days. Blockers go unnoticed until the standup, by which point half a day minimum is already lost. Retrospectives are shallow because nobody can recall the details of a two-week sprint from memory. Planning sessions overcommit because there is no fast, reliable way to factor in team velocity, public holidays, or the complexity distribution of the backlog. 

The WatsonX ScrumMaster Agent addresses this directly. It is an AI-powered agent that treats the sprint board as a source of truth that is supposed to be accurate and continuously reconciles that board against what is actually happening across GitHub, CI pipelines, Jira, and team communication channels. 

Target Users and How They Interact with the Agent:
The target users are software engineering teams running Agile sprints, specifically Scrum Masters, tech leads, and individual contributors who lose time each day to ceremony overhead and information gaps. At IBM, this maps directly to delivery teams working across client engagements where sprint hygiene, velocity tracking, and stakeholder communication are ongoing responsibilities.

Users interact with the agent through the tools they already use: Bob or watsonx for notifications and standup digests, Jira or GitHub Projects for sprint board reconciliation, and a conversational interface for on-demand queries. The agent works in the background and surfaces information proactively. A pre-standup brief arrives 15 minutes before the meeting, stale PR alerts fire when a merged-but-not-closed PR has been sitting for two days, and a scope creep warning triggers when new tickets are added mid-sprint beyond the agreed threshold. Tasks can be recommended based on member availability, current workload and priority. No new tooling or workflow changes are required from the team.

Anticipated Outcomes:
Teams using the WatsonX ScrumMaster Agent gain back time at every ceremony touchpoint. Standups become faster because the per-person digest derived from commits, PR activity, and ticket updates is already prepared before anyone speaks. Blockers surface early. Sprint planning becomes more accurate because the agent pulls historical velocity data, flags stories above the agreed complexity threshold for breakdown, and adjusts available capacity for public holidays falling within the sprint window. Retrospectives produce richer outputs because the agent drafts a structured retro document from the sprint's actual event history, not from memory.

Productivity Improvement with AI:
IBM Bob was used throughout the development of this agent to synthesise the initial idea from team brainstorm notes, generate the architecture proposal, produce the sprint plan and sub-task breakdown, scaffold the first prototype module, and draft this submission. Bob's ability to hold full project context across a session, generate implementation-ready artefacts from plain-language descriptions, and produce structured documentation from unstructured inputs made it a practical part of the team's workflow at every stage not a one-off writing tool.

Time Savings Rationale:
The agent's direct impact on team time is measurable at the ceremony level:

For a nine-person team running two-week sprints, the aggregate time saving across these touchpoints is estimated at 6–10 hours per sprint, equivalent to more than a full working day returned to the team every cycle, redirected from ceremony administration to engineering work.
